# User Guide

## Introduction

`MindMyMoney` (M<sup>3</sup>) was proposed for users with multiple payment methods who wish to track their expenditures. 
Conducting anecdotal interviews, we realized users face difficulty tracking their expenditures across different payment 
platforms on vastly different items. `MindMyMoney` was then conceptualized on the basis of tracking userâ€™s expenditures.
